Why .env is useful?
Keeps sensitive info out of version control (add .env to .gitignore)
Easy to change environment-specific configs (dev, staging, prod)
Makes docker-compose.yml cleaner and reusable

The file should be named exactly .env (no other name, no extension like .txt, .yml, etc).
If you want to use a different name (like myconfig.env), you can, but then you must tell Docker explicitly:
docker compose --env-file myconfig.env up -d
