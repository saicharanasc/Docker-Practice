What are Named Volumes?
Named volumes are persistent storage managed by Docker.
Unlike anonymous volumes, you give them a name so you can reuse them across container restarts.
Useful for databases (like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) where data should not be lost if a container is removed.


Why use Named Volumes?
✅ Data persists even if the container is stopped or removed.
✅ Easy to back up (docker volume inspect mysql_data).
✅ Can be shared between multiple containers if needed.
