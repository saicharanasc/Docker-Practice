What are Restart Policies?
Restart policies tell Docker when to restart a container if it stops, crashes, or Docker itself restarts.
Theyâ€™re super useful for production apps (like DBs, web servers) that should stay always running.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Restart Policies
You can set them in docker run --restart ... or in docker-compose.yml under a service.

1. no (default)
Container wonâ€™t restart automatically.
Use case: Dev/test containers.

2. always
Container always restarts if it stops, no matter why.
Even after Docker daemon restarts.
Use case: Production apps, databases.

3. unless-stopped
Like always, but wonâ€™t restart if you manually stop the container.
Use case: Services that should stay up but can be manually paused.

4. on-failure[:max-retries]
Restarts only if container exits with a non-zero error code.
You can limit retries (e.g., on-failure:5).
Use case: Batch jobs or scripts where you want retries only on crash.
