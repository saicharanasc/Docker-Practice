below are the docker compose basics

services: – containers you want to run (web, db, cache, etc.)

ports: – maps container port to host port (5000:5000)

depends_on: – ensures one service starts before another

volumes: – persistent data storage

environment: – pass environment variables (DB user, password, etc.)
