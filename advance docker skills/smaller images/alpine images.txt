Why Alpine?
Tiny base image (~5 MB) vs Ubuntu/Debian (~100 MB+)
Good for microservices → faster build, pull, and deploy
Helps reduce attack surface (less software installed)
⚠️ Caveat: Some libraries/tools may not be available by default (e.g., bash, glibc). You may need to install them manually.

🔹 Best Practices with Alpine
✅ Use --no-cache when installing packages:
RUN apk add --no-cache curl

✅ Pin versions to avoid breaking builds:
RUN apk add --no-cache python3=3.11.7-r0

✅ Install only what’s necessary.
