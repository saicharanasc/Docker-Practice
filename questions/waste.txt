Act like a interview panel, & ask me questions for only Docker & docker related for 3-5 years of experience also hands-on. 
and also do ask for some follow-up questions based on your questions. 
Divide your questions for 2 rounds round 1 & round 2, both rounds hould include questions from docker basics to advanced 

Now think like a top company interviewer & ask me the questions. 
and interview difficulty should be medium - hard in round 1 & hard or extreme hard in round -2
