# y i need package* ?
# is because of package-lock.json (or npm-shrinkwrap.json).

# What are these files?
# package.json → Defines your app’s dependencies (e.g. "express": "^4.18.2").
# package-lock.json → Locks exact versions (e.g. "express": "4.18.2"). This ensures every install gets the same dependency tree, avoiding “works on my machine” issues.

# 📌 Why package*?
# package* is a wildcard that matches:
# package.json
# package-lock.json
# By copying both, you make sure Docker has all dependency info.
# Then npm install will install exact versions from package-lock.json if it exists.

# 📌 If you only copy package.json
# Docker will ignore package-lock.json.
# npm install may pull slightly different versions → possible bugs in production.

# ✅ Best practice:
# Always use package*.json to keep builds consistent and predictable.
